## Texte, a figlet-like exercise

The purpose of this small program is to prove to myself (and to others) that
I'm doing actual progress learning Rust.

It is a figlet-like utility that takes standard input and prints an ASCII banner like this:

```
  ____                   _   _
 / ___|   ___     ___   | | | |
| |      / _ \   / _ \  | | | |
| |___  | (_) | | (_) | | | |_|
 \____|  \___/   \___/  |_| (_)
```

I would be most pleased if anyone cares to read the code and comment it.

### Clone the thing

```
git clone... https (wait I've got to create the repository first)
```
